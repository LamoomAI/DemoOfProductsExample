#Project description:


You build an AI helper to to choose the furniture to customer's apartment. 
Customer starts with writing what room the user wants to furniture, or what speicific space, they can write budget, rooom and goals, color, material.

Our database:
- furniture type, like chair, table, sofa, bed, and each furniture has a type. Which has tags, like size, goals, room. And they have a png picture of bird view of the furniture in a scetch format.
-  all furniture from providers, and each furniture has tags, like color, material, price, size, goals, room.
- layouts - pictures of the furniture in the room, and each layout has description of the furniture_type and quantity, room specification, like living room.

AI service:
- use Openai GPT4 for AI  inetraction.
- use Openai model encoding for vector representation of the text.

When User says what room, and what goals, and what budget, we RAG all the furniture types that can be used, and ask LLM to suggest 4 layouts of the furniture type and quantities.
After that we go in our database of layouts and get the most similar layouts, that were suggested by LLM. And we show them to the user.

User chooses the layout, and we suggest to the user 20 bundles of furniture. 
Getting color palettes - we have 20 default palettes, or if user had color preferences, we get 1-20 palettes based on the color preferences using RAG.
For all palettes we generate up to 20 bundles, where the furniture suggested by color, budget, material. 
Layout has the average price per item which should be used on calculating the weight per item, when we're restricted by budget.

User can ask to change item in the bundle, which should searched by RAG with palette of the bundle, price, material and paginated.
User chooses the bundle, and adds to the cart.


##Architecture:


# Notes:
## We're AI driven company, we use s additional intelligence needed you're using OpenAI GPT-4, 
which is a language model that can be used for text generation. Please think out of the box, when you're seeing unusual tasks.
## We use RAG for searching layouts, and furniture items, using vector representation of the text, 
by getting  embedding from `text-embedding-ada-002`, and OpenSearch as storage.
! You do not need authentication , it's already implemented, please skip that part for while. Imagine you get clear user_id in the request.

1. The best customer experience 
```
Client -> System: provide_room_details(user_str_preferences) -> GPT4: structured preferences -> based on preferences searched layouts by RAG. RETURNS: layout_suggestions
Client -> System: select_layout(layout_id). RETURNS: bundle_suggestions
Client -> System: request_item_change(bundle_id, item_change_request). RETURNS: updated_bundle
Client -> System: add_to_cart(bundle_id). RETURNS: cart_confirmation
```

### 3. ALL SEQUENCES OF SYSTEM INTERACTIONS:


#### 3.2. Receive Room Details (User -> API Gateway -> Lambda):
Full business logic: Collect and validate user's room details and preferences, takes userâ€™s input, ask GPT4 to gather details, like color, materials, budget and room, by choosing from our variants.
Any Data Transformations: Convert user input into a structured format for processing.
Storage & Database optimizations: Store user preferences in DynamoDB with efficient indexing. !!! Layouts are stored in OpenSearch.
Upstream Dependencies: User input; example format: string like "living room with budget under 1000 natural materials"
Downstream Dependencies: GPT-4 to get Structured preferences; example format: { "room_type": "living_room", "budget": 1000, "color_preferences": ["blue"], "material": "wood", "goals": ["cozy"] }
Cadence: When user provides room details.
Note:
    - Caching strategies: Cache frequent combinations of preferences.
    - Error handling: Validate input and provide user feedback for incorrect data.
    - Monitoring: Track the types of preferences users submit.
    - Feedback loop for improvement: Use data to refine suggestion algorithms.
    - Database keys: Composite key of user ID and room type.

#### 3.3. Suggest Layouts (Lambda -> OpenAI GPT-4 -> Lambda -> DynamoDB):
Full business logic: Use AI to generate layout suggestions based on user preferences.
Any Data Transformations: Encode preferences into a vector using OpenAI model encoding.
Storage & Database optimizations: Index layouts in DynamoDB for efficient similarity searches.
Upstream Dependencies: Encoded preferences; example format: { "encoded_vector": [0.12, 0.75, ...] }
Downstream Dependencies: Suggested layouts; example format: { "layouts": [{ "layout_id": "layout123", "description": "Cozy living room with a sofa and two chairs" }] }
Cadence: After receiving room details.
Note:
    - Caching strategies: Cache popular layouts.
    - Error handling: Handle AI service outages with fallback recommendations.
    - Monitoring: Use CloudWatch to monitor AI interactions.
    - Feedback loop for improvement: Analyze user choices to improve AI suggestions.
    - Database keys: Layout ID as the primary key.

#### 3.4. Generate Furniture Bundles (Lambda -> DynamoDB -> Lambda):
Full business logic: Create furniture bundles based on the selected layout and user preferences.
Any Data Transformations: Match furniture items with layout requirements and user preferences.
Storage & Database optimizations: Use DynamoDB's query and scan operations efficiently.
Upstream Dependencies: Selected layout and preferences; example format: { "layout_id": "layout123", "budget": 1000, "color_preferences": ["blue"], "material": "wood" }
Downstream Dependencies: Furniture bundles; example format: { "bundles": [{ "bundle_id": "bundle456", "items": [{ "furniture_id": "chair789", "price": 150 }] }] }
Cadence: When user selects a layout.
Note:
    - Caching strategies: Cache bundles for similar preferences.
    - Error handling: Provide alternative suggestions if no exact matches are found.
    - Monitoring: Track bundle generation performance.
    - Feedback loop for improvement: Collect user feedback on bundle satisfaction.
    - Database keys: Bundle ID as the primary key.

### 4. Any Data/Services are missing?:
- No critical data or services appear to be missing at this stage.

### 5. Suggestions for Improvement:
- Implement a cost optimization strategy by using AWS Lambda reserved concurrency for predictable workloads and AWS Savings Plans for consistent usage.
- Introduce AWS Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows, improving error handling and reducing the number of Lambda invocations.
- Utilize Amazon CloudFront with S3 for faster delivery of static content and images.
- Explore the use of AWS Lambda@Edge for low-latency user interactions and data processing closer to the user.
- Consider using Amazon Personalize to enhance the recommendation engine with machine learning capabilities.
